## Welcome

Hi! This series of articles is about teaching programming from the ground up. I will keep this tutorial informal and focus on trying to explain matters in a way understandable for people with little or no experience in programming. I hope that this helps you, the reader, in even the slightest way, to become interested in programming and learn valuable things on the way :)

## What is programming?

To keep it simple, we can call it the tool we use to make our computer do exactly what we want. In a way that's facsinating, because there are so many smartphone users outt here, but only a fraction of them know how to make full use of their pocket super computer. The common user is restricted to the functionality provided by any given app - in a sense they only ever use a subset of all available functionality their phone provides. The programmer on the other hand has access to all available functions and is only restricted by inherent software limitations, computational power and of course personal skill.

There is no app that does something you need? You can create the app. Time is wasted doing repetitive manual tasks? You can write a script to automate the process. Your favourite open source program is missing a feature? You can add that feature.

These are only a few examples of the things, programmers deem normal. Of course, skill still plays a role in the ability to program certain features. But if you understand the fundamentals and know how to properly search the internet, due to the vast amount of teaching resources, almost anything can be learned and achieved.

## How does it work?

When I was young I always wondered about that so called `programming`. It seemed almost magical. Either you're in, or out. And I was told that if you know one progrmaming language, others are easier to learn.
While this is true, the start is not smooth sailing. Programming requires a slightly different mindset and very methodical, often mathematical way of thinking, which makes the beginning hard for most people.

The term programming **language** already eludes to it's connection with regular written language. In the same way we use languages like English to communicate with each other, we use **programming languages** to communicate with a computer.

### *&nbsp;*{: .fa .fa-exclamation-circle} We will focus on traditional written languages as that's the way wurst is perceived.

Imagine someone speaking in english to you. His words enter your ear and your brain conceives words, from which it constructs sentences and makes you understand, what that person is saying to you. To make sure you understand them, the person talking to you will only use certain words, and arrange them in specific manner that is dictated by the language you two agreed upon using.
If the person would use a language you don't know, or in a way you don't understand, it would be very hard for you to grasp what they are trying to tell you.

Programming languages work in a similar way, though arguably more strict. While you might understand broken english, a computer often requires you to striictly adhere and satisfy the rules of the programming language you use to control it. However from a grammar and syntax view, this makes them much easier to learn, as there are hardly any exceptions or complicated rules. Most of this stems from the creators designing the language in such a way that it is easy to put your thoughts into code.

## Syntax?

If you're still here and I've sparked your interest, it's time to delve into the details and vocabulary. Syntax is what we call the set of rules which define how text in a certain language is written. For English an example would be word order. `I went to the house` is correct, while a different structure `To the house I went` is often attributed to some green individual. In a programming language it tells us how the source code is to be written.

## Source Code?

Source Code is what programs are made of. Source code usually comes in many small, plain text files which can be opened with any normal text editor.
